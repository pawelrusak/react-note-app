# FavNote. - React app to help you master your notes

FavNote. is the application that enables you to conveniently browse, create, remove and filter several content types like notes, favorites twitts or interesting articles and get back to the them later whenever you want.

## Getting started

Build using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) scripts. The following scripts are available:

- `start` - starts the development server,
- `build` - bundles the app into static files for production,
- `test` - starts the test runner,
- `eject` - removes this CRA tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. **If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!**,
- `storybook` - start the component explorer,
- `build-storybook` - bundles the component explorer,

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
