# React note app

Simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) serverless application to manage your notes.

## Getting stared

Build using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) scripts. The following scripts are available:

- `start` - starts the development server,
- `build` - bundles the app into static files for production,
- `test` - starts the test runner,
- `eject` - removes this CRA tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. **If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!**,
- `storybook` - start the component explorer,
- `build-storybook` - bundles the component explorer,

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
