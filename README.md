# FavNote. - React app to help you master your notes

FavNote. is the application that enables you to conveniently browse, create, remove and filter several content types like notes, favorites twitts or interesting articles and get back to the them later whenever you want.

## Getting started

**Obsolete! Will be updated soon!**

Build using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) scripts. The following scripts are available:

- `start` - starts the development server,
- `build` - bundles the app into static files for production,
- `test` - starts the test runner,
- `eject` - removes this CRA tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. **If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!**,
- `storybook` - start the component explorer,
- `build-storybook` - bundles the component explorer,

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## About the project

The project is application extension from the course ["Kurs React - W Praktyce"](https://eduweb.pl/programowanie-i-www/reactjs/react-w-praktyce) (en."React Course - in Practice") by [Adam Romanski](https://helloroman.pl/). I continued the course up to tag 0.15.0 (more about tagging [here](https://github.com/)). My main motivation for taking up the course was it's very smart UI design and interesting idea for application, which I thought showed a great potential for introducing new features (types of functionality) and technologies. However, at the end of tne course only some of the designed types of functionality worked.
